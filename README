This is the root directory of RhinoPiping sources:
   - RhinoPiping and AdditionalAttributes plugins,
   - license server.

Linux makefiles are in ./make directory.  In order to build under
linux (for the license server or some tests), first deploy makefiles
by running ./make/deploy_makefiles.sh.  Target package paths must be
passed as arguments to this command.

For example, to deploy makefiles for the license server, run:

    ./make/deploy_makefiles.sh RhinoPiping/com/server
